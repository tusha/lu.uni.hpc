* In March 2013, the Global HPC initiative in Luxembourg is reactivated with the MECO and Luxinnovation on board. Hopefully, it can lead to a Center of Excellence in HPC within Luxembourg where the UL can play a major role.
* In January 2013, a new low-power cluster have been aquired featuring ARM processors and Calxeda modules (2x48 nodes, ARM Cortex A9 4C, 10GbE interconnect). Preliminary benchmark results (84,68 MFlops/W) would rank it 430th in the world [Green500](http://www.green500.org/) list
* As of September 2012, modules environment is fully in production with numerous applications provided via EasyBuild (try: module avail)
  * For the [workshop "Luxembourg Earth Observation and Integrated Applications Day"](http://leo.lippmann.lu), the 16th of March 2012 in Mondorf-les-Bains, Jan Wuite presented [a poster on Luxembourg GPS measurements](https://hpc.uni.lu/common/docs/Poster_LEO_Wuite_FINAL.pdf) for which he used the cluster.
  * publication "On the influence of a patterned substrate on crystallization in suspensions of hard spheres", by Sven Dorosz and Tanja Schilling in the [Journal of  Chemical Physics](http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v136/i4/p044702_s1?ver=pdfcov), january 2012.
