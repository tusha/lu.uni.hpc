The interconnect is composed of an Infiniband QDR (40Gb/s) network.
The choice of topology is imposed by the heterogeneous nature of Chaos,
and by the fact that the hardware is split across 2 server rooms.
  
The following schema describes the topology of the Chaos Infiniband Network.

Additionally, the cluster is connected to the infrastructure of the University using 10Gb Ethernet.
  
A third 1Gb Ethernet network is also used on the cluster, mainly for services and administration purposes.
